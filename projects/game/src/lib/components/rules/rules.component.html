  <h5><a name="Object">Object</a></h5>
  <p>Move all your colored marbles up the board to the opposite triangle.</p>
  <h5><a name="Moves">Moves</a></h5>
  <p>Players take turns moving one marble in one of six possible directions,
    one space at a time, to an unoccupied space.
  </p>
  <h5><a name="Jumping">Jumping</a></h5>
  <p>A marble may jump an adjacent marble of any color in a straght line if the
    immediate space beyond is unoccupied. The jumping piece (and only the jumping
    piece) may continue to make similar jumps (in in any diirection) during the
    same turn. Jumping is not compulsary, and the jumped pieces are not moved nor
    removed from the board. All pieces remain in play for the entire game, except
    those of a player who resigns.</p>
  <h5><a name="Jump Multiplier">Jerry's Jump Multiplier</a></h5>
  <p>Jerry's Jump Multiplier allows a marble to jump a marble any number of spaces
    away as long as it can land the same number of spaces away on the far side and there
    are no other marbles in between on either side.
  </p>
  <p>Time for some ASCII art. Say @ is
    your jumping marble, O is any other marble, _ is an empty space, and x
    is the empty destination space.
    The following are legal jumps:<br>
    @ O x<br>
    @ _ O _ x<br>
    @ _ _ O _ _ x<br>
    @ _ _ _ O _ _ _ x<br>
    @ _ _ _ _ O _ _ _ _ x<br>
    @ _ _ _ _ _ O _ _ _ _ _ x<br>
    etc.
  </p>
  <p>The following are not legal jumps:<br>
    @ _ O x<br>
    @ _ O _ _ x<br>
    @ _ _ _ O _ O _ x<br>
    @ _ O _ _ O _ _ _ _ x
  </p>
  <p>When making multiple jumps, how you jumped the first marble
    does <b>not</b> affect how you must jump the second. The following is a legal multiple
    jump:<br>
    @ _ O _ x _ _ O _ _ x O x
  </p>
  <p>Thanks to "HornCologne" for sending the suggestion in, who in turn gives credit to Jerry for showing him.
